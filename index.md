## About Me

Dylan Sears is a PhD candidate in sociology/criminology at Kansas State University, and is currently working on his dissertation. He has taught intro to sociology and youth and crime at Kansas State University and his ongoing research projects include an analysis of Kyle Rittenhouse's rising celebrity as well as an exploration of the ongoing gentrification of Tulsa, Oklahoma's Greenwood district, also known as Black Wall Street.
